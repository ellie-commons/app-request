# App Request

## Objective

The purpose of this repository is to provide support to elementary OS applications that have stopped receiving updates, ensuring they remain functional and relevant in the short term. In the medium to long term, we plan to port these applications to GTK4 to improve their compatibility and ensure their continued use within the elementary OS ecosystem.

### How can you help?

If you know of any elementary OS applications that are no longer maintained but are still valuable to the community, let us know! You can [create an issue](https://github.com/elementary-community/app-request/issues) in this repository with the application's details and why you think it should receive support.

Additionally, if you're a developer and want to contribute by maintaining or porting applications, we would love to have your help!

### Are you a developer without time to maintain your app?

If you're the developer of an elementary OS application but no longer have time to maintain it, you can transfer ownership to this community so that we can continue providing support. This ensures that your application remains available and functional for the elementary OS community, with ongoing maintenance and future porting to GTK4.

Please reach out via the [issues section](https://github.com/elementary-community/app-request/issues) to initiate the transfer process.

### Support Plan

1. **Short term**: 
   - Identify applications in need of support.
   - Apply bug fixes and perform maintenance work.

2. **Medium term**: 
   - Port applications to **GTK4** to ensure future compatibility with elementary OS and other GTK-based environments.

3. **Long term**: 
   - Keep applications active and ensure code quality with community support.

### How to contribute

1. Check the open issues to see which applications we are currently working on.
2. Create an issue to suggest new applications that need support.
3. Feel free to submit pull requests with fixes, improvements, or new features!
